# Iteration Log

Every successful iteration records real work, tests, branch, commit SHA, and remote link.
Failed or blocked steps are reported honestly.

## Iteration #0 — Phase 0 bootstrap

- Date: 2026-10-21
- Goal: initialize the LabFlow repository, runnable backend/frontend skeletons, deterministic
  analysis tests, CI, and product documentation.
- Completed:
  - Private GitHub repository `CubicZnS/labflow`.
  - FastAPI shell with health, statistics, and fitting endpoints.
  - Deterministic analysis module with known-value tests.
  - React/Vite/Tailwind application shell with a Vitest smoke test.
  - GitHub Actions CI for backend and frontend.
  - Product roadmap, architecture, testing, business model, decisions, and agent operating docs.
- Tests:
  - Backend: `ruff check app tests` passed; `pytest -q` passed (16 tests).
  - Frontend: `pnpm typecheck` passed; `pnpm test:run` passed (2 tests); `pnpm build` succeeded.
  - Runtime smoke: `/api/health`, `/api/analysis/stats`, and `/api/analysis/fit` returned expected JSON;
    the built frontend served HTTP 200 from `vite preview`.
  - CI: GitHub Actions workflow configured for backend lint/test and frontend typecheck/test/build.
- Git branch: `main` (bootstrap commit).
- Commit SHA: `471d10335c138d428b1039b7e53f24eaa063d33a`
- GitHub: https://github.com/CubicZnS/labflow/commit/471d10335c138d428b1039b7e53f24eaa063d33a
- Known issues:
  - The MVP UI is a shell; CSV/XLSX import and charting are Phase 1–3 work.
  - No persistence, authentication, billing, or deployment yet.
  - Docker files are included but Docker is not installed on the development Mac mini, so the
    container path was not smoke-tested in this iteration.
  - FastAPI TestClient emits a Starlette/httpx deprecation warning; tests pass.
- Next iteration: Phase 1 — CSV import, validation, and basic statistics vertical slice.
